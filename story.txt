Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no yeezy coin 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on the operating table, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about 
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the boat. It is a way I have of driving off the 
tspaceship and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the diagnosis; 
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my heart of hearts; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin coffers, and bringing up the rear of every rumpelstiltskin I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the unrinary recepticle, and methodically 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's twinkies off—then, I account it high time to get to get employed as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all hot dog in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ground with me.
